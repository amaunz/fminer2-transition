Welcome to Fminer2 transition package.

This package aims to port and reproduce the KDD 2009 results on BBRC features to Fminer 2.0 version.

STEPS
=====

The application "RUNME" downloads and compiles fminer2 as well as the C++ version of lazar ("lazar-core"). It also downloads the CPDB carcinogenicity data that was used in the original study. For details see bbrc.maunz.de.
The validation is done using the original validation software (loo2summary.rb).

USAGE
=====

Assumptions: you run a debian-based environment (e.g. Ubuntu). You also have ruby installed with the gem rsruby to integrate R in ruby. This document does not cover how to set this up, see http://rubyforge.org/projects/rsruby/.

Run RUNME. It will try to download and compile fminer2, lazar-core and the cpdbdata. If compilation fails, see the respective repository READMEs at github.com/amaunz/fminer2 and github.com/amaunz/lazar-core.

If compilation was successful, it will download the cpdb data and run leave-one-out crossvalidation on it. Individual predictions can be found in the .loo file, test statistics in the .summary file. They should correspond (approximately) to the figures given in the KDD 2009 paper, which you can get from cs.maunz.de.
