Welcome to Fminer2 transition package.

This package aims to port and reproduce the KDD 2009 results on BBRC features to Fminer 2.0 version.

STEPS
=====

The application "RUNME" downloads and compiles fminer2 as well as the C++ version of lazar ("lazar-core"). It also downloads the CPDB carcinogenicity data that was used in the original study. For details see http://bbrc.maunz.de.
The validation is done using the original validation software (loo2summary.rb).

USAGE
=====

Assumptions: you run a debian-based environment (e.g. Ubuntu, used here).

1) Perhaps you have R installed, otherwise install it:
- sudo aptitude install r-base-dev r-base r-base-core
Create a link to R: 'ln -sf /usr/lib/R/lib/libR.so /usr/lib/' or whereever your libR.so resides (default).

2) Install the following packages:
- sudo aptitude install build-essential libopenbabel-dev libgsl0-dev ruby1.8-dev libboost1.40-dev
Run 'updatedb'.

3) Install the gem "rsruby" to integrate R in ruby. 
- sudo aptitude install rubygems
- export "R_HOME=/usr/lib/R"
- echo "R_HOME=/usr/lib/R" > $HOME/.bashrc
- gem install rsruby -- --with-R-dir=$R_HOME --with-R-include=/usr/share/R/include/

This document does not cover how to set this up, see http://rubyforge.org/projects/rsruby/.

4) Run RUNME. It will try to download and compile fminer2, lazar-core and the cpdbdata. If compilation fails, see the respective repository READMEs at http://github.com/amaunz/fminer2 and http://github.com/amaunz/lazar-core.


If compilation was successful, it will download the cpdb data and run leave-one-out crossvalidation on it. Individual predictions can be found in the .loo file, test statistics in the .summary file. They should correspond closely to the figures given in the KDD 2009 paper, which you can get from http://cs.maunz.de.
